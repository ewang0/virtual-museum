## Overview

METVIRTUAL is a 6-day solo project by Eric Wang, built with JavaScript and React.* In addition to searching objects in the museum's collection, users can filter their search by objects on view at the museum, and sort results by department. Image and object data is fetched from the Metropolitan Museum of Art Collection API.
